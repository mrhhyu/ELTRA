# ELTRA: An Embedding Method based on Learning-to-Rank to Preserve Asymmetric Information in Directed Graphs

This repository provides (1) the reference implementation of ELTRA, (2) the Python implementation of CRW, (3) the data, and (4) the proof for CRW scores properties.

## Installation and Usage
ELTRA is a novel similarity-based double-vector **E**mbedding method based on listwise Learning-**T**o-**R**ank (LTR) that preserves **A**symmetric information in directed graphs. It is straightforward embedding method implemented by a simple deep neural network consisting of only a projection layer and an output layer. 
In order to run ELTRA, the following packages are required:
```
Python       >= 3.8
tensorflow   >= 2.2
networkx     =2.6.*
numpy        =1.21.*
scipy        =1.7.*
scikit-learn =1.0.*
```

ELTRA can be run directly from the command line or migrated to your favorite IDE.
### Graph File Format
A graph must be represented as a text file under the *edge list format* in which, each line corresponds to an edge in the graph, tab is used as the separator of the two nodes, and the node index is started from 0. 

### ELTRA with Undirected Graphs
Although ELTRA is originally a double-vector embedding method for directed graphs, it is **applicable** to undirected graphs as well. In this case:

(1) The _symmetric_ scores are computed as follows $`X\!=\!0.5 \!\cdot\! (X\!+\!X^T)`$ where $`X \! =  \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\omega\! \cdot\! Q \!\cdot\! X \!+ \!(1\!-\!\omega)\! \cdot\! W^T\! \cdot \! X \big) \!\vee\! I`$ is calculated by Equation (6), Section 3.2.1.

(2) The top-_t_ closet nodes are selected based on the above symmetric scores **without** applying the $`AP\!=\!\bar{A}\! \odot \!X`$ part of Equation (6).

(3) Each node is represented by two latent vectors (i.e., source and target).

## Running ELTRA

ELTRA has the following parameters: 

```
--graph: Input graph

--dataset_name: dataset name

--result_dir: Destination to save the embedding result, default is "output/" in the root directory

--dim: The embedding dimension, default is 128

--topk: Number of nodes in topK; default is -1 (i.e., topK is automatically computed as explained in the paper), otherwise set the value manually

--itr: Number of Iterations to compute AP-Scores, default is 3

--epc: Number of Epochs for training, default is 150

--bch: batch size, default is -1 (i.e., it is automatically computed as explained in the paper), otherwise set the value manually

--lr: Learning rate, default is 0.0025

--reg: Regularization parameter which is suggested to be 0.001 and 0.0001 with directed and undirected graphs, respectively; default is 0.001

--early_stop: The flag indicating to stop the training process if the loss stops improving, default is True

--wait_thr: Number of epochs with no loss improvement after which the training will be stopped, default is 20

--gpu: The flag indicating to run ELTRA on GPU, default is True

--graph_type: Indicates the graph type (directed or undirected), default is directed

-- impr: Importance factor of out-links over in-links to compute AP-Scores, default is 0.6
```

### NOTE:
1- It is worth to note that **topk** plays an important role in ELTRA; therefore, in order to obtain the best effectiveness with any datasets, it is recommended to perform an appropriate parameter tuning on topk as explained in the paper, Section 4.3.1.

2- **It is recommended** to set the regularization parameter as 0.001 and 0.0001 with directed and undirected graphs, respectively.

### Sample:
1) **topk** and **bch** parameters are set _automatically_

```
python ELTRA.py --graph data/DBLP/DBLP_directed_graph.txt --dataset_name DBLP
```

2) **topk** and **bch** parameters are set _manually_

```
python ELTRA.py --graph data/DBLP/DBLP_directed_graph.txt --dataset_name DBLP --topk 50 --bch 1024
```

## CRW Scores Properties
In this Appendix, we prove that the CRW scores are _asymmetric_, _bounded_, _monotonic_, _unique_, and _always existent_.

**(1) Asymmetry: for every node-pair $`(u,v)`$ where $`u\!\neq \!v`$, $`S(u,v)\! \neq \!S(v,u)`$.**

***Proof* :** According to Equation (2), if $`u\!\neq\!v`$, $`S_k(u,v)`$ is computed by considering $`O_u`$ and $`I_u`$, while $`S_k(v,u)`$ is computed by considering $`O_v`$ and $`I_v`$; since $`O_u \!\neq\! O_v`$ and $`I_u \!\neq\! I_v`$, then $`S(u,v) \!\neq\! S(v,u)`$

**(2) Bounding: for all $`k`$,  $`0 \!\le \!S_k(u,v) \!\le\! 1`$.**

***Proof* :** As mentioned in Section 3.1.2, if $`u\! \neq \!v`$, then $`S_0(u,v)\!=\!0`$, otherwise $`S_0(u,v)\!=\!1`$; therefore $`0 \!\le \!S_0(u,v)\! \le \!1`$. It means the property holds for $`k\!=\!0`$. Now, we assume that the property holds for $`k`$ such that $`0\! \le\! S_k(u,v)\! \le\! 1`$ for *any* node-pairs $`(u,v)`$ and we prove that the property also holds for $`k\!+\!1`$ as follows. If $`u\! \neq \!v`$, $`S_{k+1}(u,v)`$ is computed by Equation (2) and according to our assumption, we know that $`S_k(u,v) \!\ge\! 0`$, thus

```math
\text{(1) } S_{k+1}(u,v) \! =  \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S_{k}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}S_{k}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big) \\
```
```math
\ge  \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} (0)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}(0)}{|I_u|}  \big)
\ge \! 0
```
also, according to the assumption, we have $`S_k(u,v) \!\le \!1`$, thus

```math
\text{(2) } S_{k+1}(u,v) \! =  \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S_{k}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}S_{k}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
\le  \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} (1)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u} (1)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
\le \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(1 +1  \big) \le \! C
```
since $`0 \!< \!C\! <\! 1`$, then $`S_{k+1}(u,v) \!< \!1`$. (1) and (2) denote that $`0\! \le\! S_{k+1}(u,v)\! <\! 1`$. Also, we know that if $`u\!=\!v`$, $`S_{k+1}(u,v)\!=\!1`$. Therefore, $`0\! \le\! S_{k+1}(u,v)\! \le \! 1`$.

**(3) Monotonicity: for every node-pair $`(u,v)`$, the sequence \{$`S_0(u,v), S_1(u,v), ..., S_k(u,v)`$\} is non-decreasing as $`k`$ increases.**

***Proof*:** If $`u\!=\!v`$, $`S_0(u,v) \!=\! S_1(u,v) \!=\! \cdots \!=\! 1`$; thus, the property holds. If $`u \!\neq\! v`$, according to Equation (2), $`S_0(u,v)\!=\!0`$ and by the bounding property, $`0 \!\le S_1(u,v)\! \le 1`$; therefore, $`S_0(u,v)\! \le \!S_1(u,v)`$, which means the property holds for $`k\!=\!0`$. We assume that the property holds for all $`k`$ where $`S_{k-1}(u,v) \! \le \!S_k(u,v) `$ for *any* node-pairs $`(u,v)`$, which means $`S_k(u,v)\!-\! S_{k-1}(u,v) \!\ge\! 0`$; we show the property holds for $`k\!+\!1`$ as follows:
```math
S_{k+1}(u,v) \!-\! S_{k}(u,v)\! =  \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S_{k}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}S_{k}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big) \!-\! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S_{k-1}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}S_{k-1}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
= \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S_{k}(i,v)-S_{k-1}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}S_{k}(j,v)-S_{k-1}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
\ge \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} (0)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}(0)}{|I_u|}  \big) \!=\!0
```

according to the assumptions, $`S_k(u,v)\! -\! S_{k-1}(u,v) \!\ge\! 0`$ and we already know that $`C\! > \!0`$ therefore, $`S_{k+1}(u,v) \!- \!S_k(u,v) \!\ge\! 0`$, which means $`S_{k+1}(u,v) \!\ge\! S_k(u,v)`$.

**(4) Existence: the fixed point $`S(*,*)`$ of the CRW equation always exists.**

***Proof*:** By the bounding and monotonicity properties, for any node-pairs $`(u,v)`$, $`S_k(u,v)`$ is bounded and non-decreasing as $`k`$ increases. A sequence $`S_k(u,v)`$ converges to $`\lim S(u,v) \!\in\! [0,1]`$, according to the Completeness Axiom of calculus. $`\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty} S_{k+1}(u,v) \!=\! \displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty} S_k(u,v)\! =\! S(u,v)`$ and the limit of a sum is identical to the sum of the limits, therefore

```math
S(u,v) = \displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} S_{k+1} =   \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} \sum_{i \in O_u} S_{k}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} \sum_{j \in I_u}S_{k}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
=   \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} \displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty}  S_{k}(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{ \sum_{j \in I_u} \displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} S_{k}(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
=   \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{ \sum_{j \in I_u} S(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big) = S(u,v)
```

**(5) Uniqueness: the solution for the fixed-point $`S(*,*)`$ is always unique.**

***Proof*:** Suppose that $`S(*,*)`$ and $`S^\prime(*,*)`$ are two solutions for the CRW equation. Also, for *all* node-pairs $`(u,v)`$, let $`\delta(u,v) \!=\! S(u,v) - S^\prime(u,v)`$ be the difference between these two solutions. Let $`M\!=\!\max\limits_{(u,v)} |\delta(u,v)|`$ be the maximum absolute value of all differences observed for some nod-pairs $`(u,v)`$ (i.e., $`|\delta(u,v)| \!= \!M)`$. We need to prove that $`M\!=\!0`$. If $`u\!=\!v`$, $`M\!=\!0`$ since $`S(u,v)\! =\! S^\prime(u,v) \!=\! 1`$. If $`u \!\neq \!v`$, $`S(u,v)`$ and $`S^\prime(u,v)`$ are computed by CRW, and we have

```math
\delta(u,v) = S(u,v) - S^\prime(u,v)
```
```math
= \; \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} S(i,v)-S^\prime(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}S(j,v)-S^\prime(j,v)}{|I_u|}  \big)
```
```math
= \; \! \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} \delta(i,v)\!}{|O_u|} +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}\delta(j,v)}{|I_u|} \big)
```
thus,

```math
M = |\delta(u,v)| = \Bigg|  \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} \delta(i,v)}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}\delta(j,v)}{|I_u|} \big) \Bigg|
```
```math
\le  \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} |\delta(i,v)|}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}|\delta(j,v)|}{|I_u|} \big)
```
```math
 \le  \frac{C}{2}\! \cdot\! \big(\frac{\sum_{i \in O_u} M}{|O_u|}\! +\! \frac{\sum_{j \in I_u}M}{|I_u|} \big)
```
```math
 = \frac{C}{2} \! \cdot\! \big(M\!+\!M) \!=\! C \!\cdot \!M
```
Since $`0\! <\! C \!< \!1`$, surely $`M\!=\!0`$.
